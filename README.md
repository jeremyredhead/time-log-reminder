Time Log Reminder
=================
> A browser addon that remind you to record your activities in a time log.

This addon is currently somewhat WIP; it currently has no options page, so to change the default time interval (30 minutes), you'll need to edit background.js
In addition, it has not yet been uploaded to AMO or any other browser addon "stores" -- so you'll have to load it as a temporary/unsigned extension. 

Anyway.
